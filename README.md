# Pixelizer
The Pixelizer has 2 modes.

# Mode 1: Pixelizer
  Turns images in a source folder and subfolders into pixels, which are the original images average RGB values of all pixels.
  this can not be undone, so only check replace if you know that you:
    A) Have a backup of the images in the folders you are replacing.
    B) the images are not important.

# Mode 2: Replacer
  A very simple side of the program that replaces all images in a folder with a source image.
  This action also can not be undone once started, so again, be weary of the above points.
  This might be "usefull" if you want to change the textures of everything in a texture pack with a single image.

Both of these modes where made for fun and are not to be used on anybody else's pc without their consent.
